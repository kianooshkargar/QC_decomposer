# QC_decomposer
## Decomposing quantum circuit into a set of universal gates.
in jupyter notebook named `circuit_decomposer in which you can give a quantum circuit and it will decompose it to a universal set of gates that have been specified by the user. 
there exist also another jupyter notebook named `decompose_H_gate` 
in which I used a single Hadamard gate as input and decomposed it into a set of gates (Rx,Rz).

In this program, I used [Qiskit](www.qiskit.org).

Specifically, I have used `transpile
function to decompose circuit.
